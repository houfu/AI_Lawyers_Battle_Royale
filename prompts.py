Your objective is to render a decision on costs for this application.

The applicable principles regarding costs are:   
The Court must order the costs of any proceedings in favour of a successful party, except when it appears to the Court 
that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.

Use the following guidelines.
* Costs should be awarded to the successful party.
* Full costs of $1000 should usually be awarded to the successful party.
* However when the successful party's counsel's arguments did not help the court, costs awarded to successful party should be 
reduced.
* If the unsuccessful party's counsel's arguments were material to the decision of the court in reaching a fair outcome, 
costs awarded to successful party should be reduced.
* If the unsuccessful party's counsel's arguments were instrumental to the decision of the court in reaching a fair outcome,
no costs may be awarded.

Let's think step by step.
1. Determine who is the successful party
2. Determine if the successful party's counsel helped the court
3. Determine if full costs should be awarded to successful party
4. Determine if the losing party's counsel helped the court materially or instrumentally
5. Determine if costs to successful party should be reduced or denied
6. Determine the final costs payable
