(2)  If the requested documents are not in the party’s possession or control, the Court may order that party to file an affidavit stating this, as well as whether that party had such possession or control previously and if so, when that party parted with possession or control and what has become of the requested documents.","To show that requested documents are material to the issues in discovery, a requesting party would need to demonstrate a nexus between the pleaded causes of action and the documents they want discovered. They can do this by filing a supporting affidavit that describes the documents in respect of which the order is sought and shows, if practicable by reference to any pleading served or intended to be served in the proceedings, that the documents are relevant to an issue arising or likely to arise out of the claim made or likely to be made in the proceedings or the identity of the likely parties to the proceedings, or both. Additionally, when discovery is sought against another party to the action, the relevance of the discovery should be determined by reference to the pleadings that have defined the ambit of the contest.","Plaintiff represents a pharmacy.
